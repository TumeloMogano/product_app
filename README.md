ðŸ“¦ Product App
Product App is a simple full-stack CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using ASP.NET Web API for the backend and Angular for the frontend. It allows users to manage a list of products through a user-friendly interface.

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack
Backend: ASP.NET Web API (RESTful controllers)

Frontend: Angular

ðŸ§© Features
Add Products: Users can add new product entries with custom details.

View Products: All products are displayed on a product listing page.

Edit Products: Users can modify existing product details directly from the listing.

Delete Products: Products can be easily removed when no longer needed.

ðŸ”„ Application Flow
The ASP.NET Web API exposes RESTful endpoints through controller classes that handle HTTP requests for product-related actions. The Angular frontend consumes these endpoints to fetch, display, and manipulate product data in real time.

ðŸŽ¯ Purpose
This project demonstrates end-to-end CRUD functionality, client-server communication, and separation of concerns in a modular full-stack application â€” making it a great learning tool for beginner developers.
